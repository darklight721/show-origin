# show-origin package

An [Atom](https://atom.io) package to show the origin of a line in the git repo.


Idea from: [Every line of code is always documented](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/).

### Usage

First, make sure your project is on git.

1. Select a line in your code.
2. Press `ctrl-alt-o` to show the origin. Or right click and select `Show origin of line`.

To customize the keymap of this package, add `show-origin:show` command to your `keymap.cson`.
